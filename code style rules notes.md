### code syntax rules
* No abreviations used for naming variables, functions, error messages, etc.
* Follow a linter for syntax rules
* Keep readability the first priority.
* COMMENT, COMMENT, COMMENT!!!!  Try to keep them short and succinct.
One or two sentences may be all that's needed but please use them!
* Follow the DRY (DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF) principle.  Write functions for things which are used in multiple places.
