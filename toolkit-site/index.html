          <p>PEST analysis comes from Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar&apos;s 1964 book Scanning the 
          Business Environment. There are many variations on the model. This version, <a href="https://www.professionalacademy.com/blogs/marketing-theories-pestel-analysis" target="_blank">
          from management training firm Professional Academy</a>, seems well suited to our purpose of an 
          environmental scan for evaluating the openness of public meetings. The letters have been 
          rearranged to STEEPLE so it is easier to remember and also organizes some related concepts 
          in a more logical order (example: political next to legal).</p>

        <h2>Meeting Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Our meeting evaluation tools will be based on the following findings by 
          Code for Asheville, <a href="https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/" target="_blank">Accessibility Beyond Compliance</a>, as well as additional sources on usability: </p>
          <p>During the creation of this policy proposal, the following challenges with public 
            participation were identified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up 
                process that requires disclosure of unnecessary personal information.</li>
                <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications 
                  to documents that were posted previously.</li>
                  <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as 
                    the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is 
                    challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public 
                    meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
                    <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be 
                      difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

               <p>This section contains a series of questions that tie together themes from evaluation of multiple 
                local meetings.</p>
                <p>Do meeting the agendas posted before the meeting clearly show what agenda items can and cannot be
                  commented on by the public? Are there any recommendations for improvement in how participation 
                  opportunities are shown?</p>
