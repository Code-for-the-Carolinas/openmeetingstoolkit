           <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville 
        attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a policy proposal, gathered support, and 
        presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in their project to improve access to local
        government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code for America recognized this scaling project 
        as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint. 
        
        This website provides resources to support a team of volunteers using the Toolkit to improve access to public meetings in their North Carolina community. 
        Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, doing an environmental scan of local community features that affect public meetings, forms for taking 
        structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and examples of recommendations.

<!--Local Scan & Toolkit Instruction Section-->
    <section id="scan-section">
      <h2>Local Scan</h2>
      
      <p>
        Start by getting to know some background about public meetings in your community. The Toolkit's local scan includes two activities to help you prepare: 
        a map of public meetings and an environmental scan, called a STEEPLE analysis.

        </summary>
        <p>
The Public Meetings in North Carolina map is a tool to visualize and learn about public meetings in North Carolina.
	</p>

	<ul><li>Adding meetings to the map is a jump-right-in activity that lets any new volunteer contribute to the Open Meeting Toolkit project.</li>
	<li>The map can be a compelling visual for outreach to engage new participants.	</li>
	<li>The map can be useful to local teams planning to evaluate meetings.	</li>
	<li>We can support local teams by helping to complete maps for their communities.</li>
	<li>We could find a partner who commits to host and maintain the map (not very likely).</li>
	<li>Local teams could find partners who commit to hosting and maintaining maps for their county (more likely).	</li>
	<li>Code for the Carolinas has not committed to completing or maintaining the map.</li></ul>
<p>
To add meetings to the map, provide a comma-separated value (.csv) file containing the fields from the Data Dictionary to the Code for the Carolinas team. 
Include as many fields as possible for the meetings in your community, keeping in mind that some information may not be available online. You can collect this 
data in any spreadsheet program. Once you have collected the data, export it in .csv format and save it as meetings.csv. Provide it to Code for the Carolinas.

          <h3>Complete a STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
		The STEEPLE Analysis helps you get to know about your community in ways that will help you identify barriers to participating in public meetings. When the project 
		team shared this part of the Toolkit with Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville, they said this type of up-front analysis would have made their work a lot easier!
	      
	      <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
          It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
          in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
          to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
          We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which
          asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
          Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
          so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order
          (example: political next to legal).
        </p>

        <!-- Instructions -->
        <details>
          <summary><span>STEEPLE Analysis Instructions:</span></summary>
          <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one hour to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
            analysis to help your own local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings.
		  
	 <p><strong>Temporary Instructions</strong></p>
	 <br>
	 <p><strong>These instructions are for teams starting to use the Toolkit at the DemocracyLab Hackathon on September 10, 2022. 
	We expect revised instructions to be posted by September 30th. Using these temporary instructions, all members of the Open Meeting Toolkit Baserow group
	will be able to access your Toolkit data, including STEEPLE Analysis, any contact information you include for team members, and meeting evaluations. 
	Code for the Carolinas members will only use this information to help you with troubleshooting and to improve the Toolkit, such as revising data types. 
	We will not analyze your responses or commit to retaining them after December 31, 2022. Keep this in mind when deciding what to include in the Toolkit. 
	You may want to export your responses and save them locally.</strong>
		  
          </p>

          <p><strong>Prepare Baserow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Local Team Leaders should make sure that you and/ or at least one member of your team has a <a
                href="https://baserow.io/" target="_blank">Baserow</a> account and is a member of the Open Meeting Toolkit group. A member of Code for the Carolinas can use your email address to add you to the group and invite you to Baserow. 
		    Baserow is free, open source software.
            </li>
	    <li>Locate the Open Meeting Toolkit database in the sidebar on left side of the screen and <a href="https://baserow.io/user-docs/create-a-database" target="_blank">duplicate</a> it using the three-dot menu.

             <figcaption>Baserow sidebar with Open Meeting Toolkit showing three-dot menu</figcaption>
		</figure></li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>
          <p>Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are two things to consider:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
              acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in a breakout room, in chat, 
              <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each part. You can
            always go back and adjust your responses in Baserow. You will have a text box on the last page of the survey
            (Ethical) where you can include any additional information or clarify your answers.</p>
<!--To complete the whole form as a team (This is the only option we will recommend at the Hackathon. Commenting out the other option.): -->
          <ol>
            <li>Choose one person to take notes on your team's work.</li>
            <li>From the STEEPLE Analysis table in your database, click on the STEEPLE Social form.

            <li>Use the Share form function to create a link to the STEEPLE Social form. Send that link to the person who will record and submit your team's responses. You may choose to do that yourself as team lead, or have someone else do it. That person does not need a Baserow account.

	      </li>
            <li>Complete and submit the pages of the STEEPLE Analysis form in order. While you can't go backward on the form, you can change your responses directly in the STEEPLE Analysis table in Baserow. You can also use the link to generate a new, blank form and complete only the pages you want to change.</li>
          </ol>
	  <p>
	The STEEPLE analysis and meeting evaluation questions are listed below so that you can easily review them while you prepare or refer to them while you complete the Baserow forms. There are also links to

	<h2>Meeting Marathon Plan</h2>
    <p>
	    When your team has completed the local scan, it's time to plan which meetings you will attend. Look over meeting data for your community on the map of public meetings, 
	    on the meetings data file your team prepared, or on the website of your local government. 
	    </p><p>
	    For fun, use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rzDyY1SPl5N68InYZ6To4OyWwdS5qRcGnJvGjq3oouE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Meeting Marathon template</a>  to organize your team's plan around the theme of a Meeting Marathon. Because some of the most common races are 5K, 10K and marathons (26.2 miles)
	    challenge your team to pledge to attend 5, 10, or 26 meetings! Make a copy of the Google Document, complete the table with the date, public body, 
	    and team member for each meeting. Don't forget to allow a week before the meeting and a week after the meeting to check information for the Before Meeting
	    and After Meeting evaluation forms. Keep the template for your records so you can follow up with teammates and encourage them.

      <h2>Meeting Evaluation</h2>
      <p>Our meeting evaluation tools are based on Code for Asheville's summary of their observations, <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/checklists/web-checklist/" target="_blank">resources on plain language from the U.S. government</a>,

          <h4>Code for Asheville's findings</h4>
        </summary> 
	    <p>During Code for Asheville's observations of public meetings, they identified the following challenges with public
        participation and described them in their proposed  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDj9Ey7xh52bENqU2oYct6AQxLd8hJv-bY0B_9ZvCajC4cfFCdnQ_2_4QRHWxeEFgf7LkuHkMfg6Ed/pub" target="_blank">Open Meetings Policy</a>:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>The ever-changing processes for public comment makes it unclear how the public can participate in public comment, and difficult to know what to expect from the process.</li>
	<li>Public comment and other opportunities for feedback are not provided at every meeting - there should be consistent, ongoing opportunities for public input.</li>
	<li>Public comment is not allowed for all agenda items, and the criteria under which comment is allowed varies between public bodies. </li> 
	<li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up process that requires disclosure of unnecessary personal information.</li>
	<li>Due to technical or process issues, residents have been disconnected or skipped during public comment periods. We lack a fair process to ensure these residents are provided an opportunity to participate.</li>
	<li>Meeting materials are not posted online in advance of meetings on a clear, consistent schedule. Meeting minutes are not consistently posted in a timely manner after meetings.</li>
	<li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications to documents that were posted previously.</li>
	<li>Local government entities publish meeting information on a variety of platforms and websites, making it difficult to know which source of information is the official (and most up-to-date) source of information. This creates additional work for staff and board members as any updates need to be posted in multiple locations.</li>
	<li>Basic board information, such as membership, contact information, meeting schedules, and bylaws are not posted or updated consistently for all public bodies.</li>
	 <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
          the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
          challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
          meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
        <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be
          difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

      <h3>Meeting Evaluation Synthesis </h3>
      <p>This section contains a series of questions that tie together themes from evaluation of multiple
        local meetings.</p>
      <p>Do meeting the agendas posted before the meeting clearly show what agenda items can and cannot be
        commented on by the public? Are there any recommendations for improvement in how participation
        opportunities are shown?</p>

    <section id="faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	    
	<h3>What is a public meeting?</h3>
	<p>We use the term public meeting to refer to local government meetings that are required by law (<a href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_143/Article_33C.pdf"
              target="_blank">"NC General Statute Chapter 143 33C"</a>) to allow the public to 
	attend and, in some cases, to provide public comment. From the statute: "public body" means any elected or appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council,
	or other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities, school administrative units, constituent institutions of The University of North Carolina, or other political
	subdivisions or public corporations in the State that (i) is composed of two or more members and (ii) exercises or is authorized to exercise a legislative, policy-making, 
	quasi-judicial, administrative, or advisory function." There are a few additional considerations, so if you are in doubt, please consult the statute.</p>  	
	<br>
	<h3>Can I use the Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas in other places besides North Carolina?</h3>
	<p>There is some interest in adapting the Toolkit for use in other places. Right now, it provides resources for North Carolina.</p>	    
	<br>
	<h3>Does my local team need to have a leader?</h3>
	<p>No, the Toolkit can be used by self-directed teams who share responsibility.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>What if I notice a technical problem or want to suggest an improvement?</h3>
	<p>The Toolkit is being developed by civic technology volunteers. If you are a civic technology volunteer yourself and know how to fix the problem, we	
	invite you to  <a href="https://github.com/Code-for-the-Carolinas/openmeetingtoolkit" target="_blank">collaborate with us on GitHub</a>. You are also welcome
	to contact Code for the Carolinas by email: info at codeforthecarolinas dot org.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Is the Toolkit suitable for research?</h3>	
	<p>No, the Toolkit provides a structure and resources for local teams to make observations to help inform improvements to public meetings in 
	their own communities. Findings from the Toolkit are not intended for publication or as contributions to general knowledge. Use of the Toolkit may
	involve recording some public information about public officials, but in general it is for recording information about public meetings, not people.</p>
