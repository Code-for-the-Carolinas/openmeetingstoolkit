      <h2><span>Welcome!</span> The Open Meeting Toolkit helps community-based teams, such as Code for America
        Brigades, to evaluate and improve the openness of local public meetings while engaging civic technology volunteers. </h2>
      <br>
           <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville 
        attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a policy proposal, gathered support, and 
        presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in their project to improve access to local
        government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code for America recognized this scaling project 
        as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint. 
        
        This website provides resources to support a team of volunteers using the Toolkit to improve access to public meetings in their North Carolina community. 
        Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, doing an environmental scan of local community features that affect public meetings, forms for taking 
        structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and examples of recommendations.

          <h3>Complete a STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
          It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
          in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
          to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
          We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which
          asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
          Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
          so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order
          (example: political next to legal).
        </p>

          <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one hour to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
            analysis to help your own local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings.

          <p><strong>Prepare Baserow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Local Team Leaders should make sure that you and/ or at least one member of your team has a <a
                href="https://baserow.io/" target="_blank">Baserow</a> account. Baserow is free, open source software
              and the Toolkit is a Baserow template.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://baserow.io/user-docs/setting-up-a-group" target="_blank">Set up a Group</a> in Baserow
              for your team's Open Meeting Toolkit work. Add any team members who want to work in Baserow to your group.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://baserow.io/user-docs/create-a-database" target="_blank">Duplicate</a> the Open Meeting
              Toolkit database using the three-dot menu.
              <p><img src="./toolkit-site/assests/how-to-duplicate-the-database-using-the-three-dot-menu.jpg"

            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>
          <p>Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are three things to consider:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
              acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Will you work through the whole form together or divide up the questions? Instructions for both approaches
              are below. The whole team approach may be better if team members want more support with the activity.
              Dividing the questions, then coming back together to complete the Ethical questions, will probably go
              faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in a breakout room, in chat, 
              <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each part. You can
            always go back and adjust your responses in Baserow. You will have a text box on the last page of the survey
            (Ethical) where you can include any additional information or clarify your answers.</p>
<!--To complete the whole form as a team: -->
          <ol>
            <p><u><strong>To complete the whole form as a team:</strong></u></p>
            <li>Choose one person to take notes on your team's work.</li>
            <li>From the STEEPLE Analysis table in your database, click on the STEEPLE Social form.
              <p><img src="./toolkit-site/assests/click-on-STEEPLE-social-form.jpg"

            </li>
            <li>Use the Share form function to create a link to the STEEPLE Social form. Send that link to the person who will record and submit your team's responses. You may choose to do that yourself as team lead, or have someone else do it. That person does not need a Baserow account.

                alt="click on share form to create a link to send to who will record and submit teams responses"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Complete and submit the pages of the STEEPLE Analysis form in order. While you can't go backward on the form, you can change your responses directly in the STEEPLE Analysis table in Baserow. You can also use the link to generate a new, blank form and complete only the pages you want to change.</li>

          Compliance</a>, as well as additional sources on usability: </p>
      <p>During the creation of this policy proposal, the following challenges with public
        participation were identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up
          process that requires disclosure of unnecessary personal information.</li>
        <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications
          to documents that were posted previously.</li>
        <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
          the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
          challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
          meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
        <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be
          difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Meeting Evaluation Synthesis </h3>
      <p>This section contains a series of questions that tie together themes from evaluation of multiple
        local meetings.</p>
      <p>Do meeting the agendas posted before the meeting clearly show what agenda items can and cannot be
        commented on by the public? Are there any recommendations for improvement in how participation
        opportunities are shown?</p>
