      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and
        Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a
        policy proposal, gathered support, and presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in
        their project to improve access to local government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code
        for America recognized this scaling project as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website provides resources to support a team of volunteers using the Toolkit to improve access to public
        meetings in their North Carolina community. Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, doing an environmental scan of local community
        features that affect public meetings, forms for taking structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and
        examples of ways to recommend improvements through feedback, policy change, and partnerships. All Toolkit resources are hosted by Sunshine Request on their GitHub and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Irt-PMG0ZBGti6Dea2fg8Fc7NrM05f4N">Google Workspace</a>. 
        A team leader should create a Google Folder for your team's files related to the Open Meeting Toolkit. At least one member of your team should be proficient with the Google Suite. 
        GitHub knowledge will only be needed if your team chooses to host a local copy of the map.
      </p>
    </section>
    <!--Local Scan & Toolkit Instruction Section-->
	 <h2>Local Scan</h2>

      <p>
        Start by getting to know some background about public meetings in your community. The Toolkit's local scan
        includes two activities to help you prepare: a map of public meetings and an environmental scan, called a STEEPLE analysis. Consider hosting
        one or more kickoff events for your team to do these activities as they prepare to use the Toolkit.</p>

	<h3>Add Meetings to the Map</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The Public Meetings in North Carolina map is a tool to visualize and learn about public meetings in North
          Carolina. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding meetings to the map is a jump-right-in activity that lets any new volunteer contribute to the project.</li>
          <li>The map can be a compelling visual for outreach to engage new participants. </li>
          <li>The map can be useful to local teams planning to evaluate meetings. </li>
          <li>Neither Sunshine Request nor Code for the Carolinas has committed to completing or maintaining a statewide map. Your team also has no obligation to complete or maintain a local map. If you identify a local community organization with a
          long-term interest in open government, you may want to consider making a local version of the map for that partner organization to host and maintain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS AND OFFICIAL DATA DICTIONARY WILL BE PROVIDED HERE</strong>
          To add meetings to the statewide map, provide a comma-separated value (.csv) file containing the fields from the Data
          Dictionary to the Sunshine Request team.
          Include as many fields as possible for the meetings in your community, keeping in mind that some information
          may not be available online. You can collect this
          data in any spreadsheet program. Once you have collected the data, export it in .csv format and save it as
          meetings.csv. Provide it to Sunshine Request.

        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis helps you get to know your community in ways that will help you identify barriers
          to participating in public meetings. When the Code for the Carolinas team shared this part of the Toolkit with 
          Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville, they said that this type of
          up-front analysis would have made their work a lot easier!

        <!-- Instructions -->
        <details>
          <summary><span>STEEPLE Analysis Instructions:</span></summary>
          <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one to two hours to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
            analysis to help your local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings. The analysis can be done online or in person. We
            do recommend that you bring team members together to work on the analysis at the same time. As a local team leader, you should read the complete instructions in advance to prepare for the activity.</p> 

            <p>Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are two things to consider:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
                acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in a breakout room, in chat,
                <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method. Consider using a brief icebreaker that invites participants to share
                about their connections to the community, like "Compare [your community] to another place you have lived or visited." or "How would you describe [your community] to someone who just moved here?"
              </li>
            </ol></p>

          <p><strong>Access the Google Form</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>A local team leader should access the Open Meeting Toolkit Folder in the Sunshine Request Google Workspace and make a copy of the Open Meeting Toolkit STEEPLE Analysis form. </li>
            <li>Click on the Send button at the upper right. <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2839588?hl=en" target="_blank"> Use the Email or Get a link option</a> to share a link to the form.</li>
            <li>Provide the link to the team member who will complete the form. This can be yourself or another team member. </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>

          <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. The full text of the question is listed below so all team members can easily refer to them. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each part. There is a text box at the end of the survey
            where you can include any additional information or clarify your responses. The form is set to automatically save your responses as they are entered. You can
            always go back and adjust your responses in the Google Form. To maximize learning as a team and as individuals, work on all parts of the analysis together as a team. Ideally all team members will help with 
            the STEEPLE analysis, with one person entering the team's answers into the form. There are some time-saving suggestions for breaking up the work in the Political and Legal sections. It is especially valuable for 
            the whole team to work together on the Ethical section.</p>

      <h2>Meeting Marathon Plan</h2>
      <p>
        When your team has completed the local scan, it's time to plan which meetings you will attend. Look over meeting
        data for your community on the Map of Public Meetings, on the meetings data file your team prepared, or on the website of your local government. 
        We recommend that you create an initial plan to observe meetings over a period of three months, then begin to analyze your evaluations as a team.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>You are welcome to analyze your team's findings using any method that is comfortable for you. We have developed a suggested method of analysis aligned with the Open Meetings Policy developed by Code for Asheville and Sunshine Request.</p>
<p>The Open Meetings Policy is divided into sections, including Basic Public Body Information, Public Meeting Information, Public Meeting Materials, Meeting Procedure, and Public Participation. The analysis approach described here has the 
  goal of helping you understand whether the problems they found also exist in your community. This can be a starting point to make a decision about whether you want to recommend the same or similar policy changes as they did.  </p>
  <p>
    The Analysis Spreadsheet you have used to collect Meeting Evaluations contains Google Sheets macros that can be used to view columns with responses related to each section of the policy proposal. What each macro does is explained on the 
    Macro Descriptions tab of the Analysis Spreadsheet. After using a macro to refine a view, use the AllColumns macro to unhide all columns before using another macro.

    <section id="recommendations-section">
      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p> As you decide what changes to recommend, here are two approaches to consider: <strong>Policy</strong> & <strong>Partnerships</strong>. </p>
      <h2>Policy</h2>
      <p> As you consider policy recommendations, review the political and legal sections of your STEEPLE Analysis. Look
	<h3>What if I notice a technical problem or want to suggest an improvement?</h3>
      <p>The Toolkit is being developed by civic technology volunteers. If you are a civic technology volunteer yourself
        and know how to fix the problem, we
        invite you to <a href="https://github.com/Code-for-the-Carolinas/openmeetingtoolkit" target="_blank">collaborate
          with us on GitHub</a>. 
      <br>
      <h3>What if we didn't attach the Analysis Spreadsheet to our Google Form?</h3>
      <p>If you didn't attach the spreadsheet before collecting responses, you can still use the analysis macros. Copy your responses from the Responses tab of the Form to the Analysis Spreadsheet. 
      <br>
      <h3>Is the Toolkit suitable for research?</h3>
      <p>No, the Toolkit provides a structure and resources for local teams to make observations to help inform
        improvements to public meetings in
        their own communities. Findings from the Toolkit are not intended for publication or as contributions to general
        knowledge. Use of the Toolkit may
        involve recording some public information about public officials, but in general the Toolkit is for recording
        information about public meetings, not about people.</p>
